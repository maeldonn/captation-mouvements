              <p>
                In unity, each scene represents a level. A scene is composed of
                a number of GameObject, which are all the elements that are
                present. They range from light source to 3d objects and UI
                elements. The behavior of these gameObjects is defined by their
                components. Components are usually scripts, but can also be
                shaders, colliders or particle effects. What we are interested
                in are the scripts we have made and put on different gameObject,
                and how we link them together.
              </p>
              <p>
                When a script is meant to be attached to a gameObject (acting as
                a component), the class that are inside must inherit from
                <a
                  href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html"
                  >MonoBehavior</a
                >, the base class from which every Unity script derives. It
                grants access to some useful methods, such as the
                &quot;Start&quot; and &quot;Update&quot;, which are respectively
                called when the scene is launched and at every frame. But, for
                the sake of clarity, we choose to limit as much as possible the
                instance of such classes.
              </p>
              <p>
                Indeed, having multiple scripts with routine makes it more
                difficult for a developer to proofread the code. So, we&#39;ve
                decided to centralize as much as the code execution, with a
                single class acting as a &quot;main&quot;. This class is the
                &quot;GameManager&quot;.
              </p>
              <p>
                Another problem to take care of is the access to certain objects
                or variables in the differents scripts. For example, many
                scripts need the &quot;player&quot; gameObject: the usual method
                in unity is to make the variable accessible in the script, and
                then drag and drop the gameObject in the inspector of unity. But
                it becomes a bit redundant if many objects needs it, and the
                developer must know the script very well to avoid forgetting an
                instance of the object. To remedy this problem, we have chosen
                to put all the variable that the developer needs to drag and
                drop on only on class, the gameManager. Then, every other class
                will only call the gameManager and ask for such variables.
                Moreover, some variables are needed in many other classes, but
                aren&#39;t specified by the player: for theses we have a class
                &quot;Store&quot;.
              </p>
              <p>
                Finally, another important note about the organisation of the
                program is our focus on the ease of use. This translates into
                our choice to limit to the maximum the number of scripts the
                developer must add to the scene for it to work.
              </p>

              <p>
                //TODO: the script organization might still change, will do
                later

                The GameManger is the entry point of our program. It contains
                all the variables the developer must specify, takes care of the
                initialization of the different scripts and their updates.

                software, and the tweaked one, which can be used to make a dummy
                play an animation from a bvh file.
